Deep Dive: Violation Card

Click any row and open the Violation Card — your single-screen overview of everything that matters:
	•	Check status (e.g., Violations, Cleared)
	•	Accounts checked and rule triggers count
	•	Number of accounts with violations
	•	Source of check (manual audit, anti-fraud system, case logs, etc.)
	•	Assigned reviewer
	•	Start date & time
	•	Linked cases with priority and owner
	•	Accounts by violation type — clickable links for instant follow-up

With this view, you instantly understand the scope, context, and ownership of every violation — and can act without switching tabs or hunting through logs.
